# Stock-Insight-Project
"Stock Insight" project will be a simple tool that helps predict stock prices.  

We are going to create an interactive dashboard that leverages the historical data of the S&P 500 index for insightful time series analysis, aiming to illuminate potential future market trends. This endeavor seeks to address the critical challenge investors face in long-term investing and day trading: identifying optimal moments for buying and selling to maximize profits and minimize losses. By predicting market volatility through analysis of past market performance, our goal is to provide a tool that can significantly enhance the decision-making process for traders.
